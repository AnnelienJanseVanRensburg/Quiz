Step 1:
Welcome to the first part of the Accessibility Quiz. As you are becoming a seasoned HTML and CSS developer, we have started you off with the basic boilerplate.
Start this accessibility journey by providing a lang attribute to your html element. This will assist screen readers in identifying the language of the page.


Step 2:
You may be familiar with the meta element already; it is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author.
Give your page a meta element with an appropriate charset value.
The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and, nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers.


Step 3:
Continuing with the meta elements, a viewport definition tells the browser how to render the page. Including one betters visual accessibility on mobile, and improves SEO (search engine optimization).
Add a viewport definition with a content attribute detailing the width and initial-scale of the page.


Step 4:
Another important meta element for accessibility and SEO is the description definition. The value of the content attribute is used by search engines to provide a description of your page.
Add a meta element with the name attribute set to description, and give it a useful content attribute.
